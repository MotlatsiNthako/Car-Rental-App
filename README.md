# Car-Rental-App
This is a car Rental app developed in IONIC. It allows users to create an account and book a car online. Once the user is logged in they can see a list of registered
car broker companies where they can book a car and also check the location of each company through Google maps. Some of the apps features are checking location using 
Google maps, checking the device's battery status, checking type of network connection the device is connected to and using the device camera.

**NB**
The app is still under develoment and some of the features are not yet working!
